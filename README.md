# microcontrollers
I have been experimenting with Arduino Uno, Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE, Particle Photon as part of my course projects at OCAD University. I organized files so that it is in a suitable category (Folder).

In wearables,
- Using Adafruit Feather 32u4 BLE, the device will connect GSR sensor to a smart phone to get GSR readings. Which can be later used for data visualization (eg. projection mapping).
- Using a Particle Photon, the device buttons can send messages, through wifi (IFTTT.com), to any application. This gadget can be worn by anyone, from elder people to young kids. By pressing any of the three buttons, the device will notify the designated people, pre-programmed by the user themselves.
