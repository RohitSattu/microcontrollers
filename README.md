# microcontrollers
I have been experimenting with Arduino Uno, Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE, and Particle Photon as part of my course projects at OCAD University. I organized files so that it is in a suitable category (Folder). 
# wearables
In wearables,
- Using Adafruit Feather 32u4 BLE, the device will connect GSR sensor to a smart phone to get GSR readings. Which can be later used for data visualization (eg. projection mapping).
- Using Particle Photon, the device buttons can send messages, through wifi (IFTTT.com), to any application. This gadget can be worn by anyone, from elder people to young kids. By pressing any of the three buttons, the device will notify the designated people, pre-programmed by the user themselves.
- Using Arduino Uno and a stretch sensor, the device will measure user movement and notify the user if they are slouching. 

# distance
- Using Arduino Uno and an ultrasonic sensor, the device will flash red/green/blue light depending on users distance.

# motion
- Using Arduino Uno, motion sensors, and servo-motor, I made a sample surveillance model which can detect motion and accordingly by turning in the direction where motion was sensed.

# LED Matrix (Do you have OCD?)
- Using Arduino Uno and a 32x32 LED Matrix, I made a visualization of an eye.
