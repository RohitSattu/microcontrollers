 * 
 * Ultrasonic Sensor: Trig sends out a signal and Echo receives the reflected signal.
 * Depending on how much time it took for the signal from trig to reach echo, ultrasonic sensor calculates the distance. 
 * 
 * Time = distance / speed; (Speed of sound = 340 m/s)
 * Using the formula above you can find the distance between sensor and object in centi-meters
